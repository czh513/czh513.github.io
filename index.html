<A NAME="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></A>
<ul>

<li> 
I am a research-intensive academic in STEM (Infomation Technology), as an ARC DECRA Fellow, and Senior Lecturer & Enterprise Fellow in AI.

UniSA is a <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/about-unisa/university-achievements/">top young university</a> globally recognised as strong <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/impact-stories/">research impact and industry engagement</a>, located at <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/about-unisa/working-at-unisa/living-in-adelaide/">Adelaide</a> - to be a New <a href="https://adelaideuni.edu.au">Adelaide University</a> from 2026. 

I am leading <b>Human-Agent Interaction and Learning (HAIL) </b> research area, and my research innovations build the bridge between human cognition and AI agents and their applications to support decision-making, including brain-computer interface, deep reinforcement learning, human-in-the-loop reasoning, multi-agent systems, and relevant applications (e.g., clinical/healthcare, ground transportation and space)</a>.
</li> 

</p> 

<li> 
I received the prestigious ARC <a href="https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra">Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)</a> Fellowship 2022 and currently hold an inaugural UniSA <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/unisanews/2022/july/story9/"> Enterprise Fellowship</a> 2021, which provide research-intensive career development. 

Before joining UniSA, I worked at the University of Technology Sydney and University of Tasmania, and completed my PhD in <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute">Australian AI Institute</a>.

<b>Research Expectations: </b>

<ul>

<li> <b>Expectations to students:</b>
If you are interested in doing a PhD, please think about it carefully before committing yourself to a PhD -
<a href= "http://www.aamircheema.com/PhD-guide.php">Should you really do PhD?</a>
In addition to being diligent, honest and willing to learn new knowledge "on your own", you also need to demonstrate a solid background in computer science or related STEM fields and a genuine passion for solving critical emerging research problems.
Your research outcomes shall target top-tier conference/journal publications or real-world impact to industry partners. 
</li>

<li> <b>From supervisor support:</b>
PhD full scholarship, comprehensive training and career development will be provided for a mutual interest research area in 6 incremental levels: awareness, understanding, replication, elaboration, innovation, and pioneer. 
I commit at least 1-2 hours/week individual (1:1) meeting for each student to discuss research progress, particularly in the beginning period of the research journey. 
I also strongly support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and networking opportunities. 
I have co-supervised over 10 students to graduate, and my primarily supervised students are highly sought after by good employers, for both internship and full-time opportunities.
