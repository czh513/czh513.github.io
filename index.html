<A NAME="Recruitment"><h2>Recruitment</h2></A>

<b>To Prospective Students:</b>

<ul>

<li> I am always open to self-motivated, outstanding <b>PhD students</b> who demonstrated strong background in my research areas. 
Interested candidates for PhD opportunities are strongly encouraged to contact me by <a href="mailto:zhcaonctu@gmail.com">email</a>. 
Please attach your CV with academic transcripts and English test (if applicable), and discuss your research interest and experience. 
The PhD scholarship will be provided through my research grant or university financial support. </li>

<li> I am always open to working with <b>honour and master students</b> for research projects, and I usually take up to 2 students each year. 
Don't hesitate to get in touch with me by <a href="mailto:zhcaonctu@gmail.com">email</a> and specify your research interest. 
The programming skill is required by demonstrating at least one programming language (Python, Java, C++, C ...). 
A vacation research scholarship may be provided to domestic students from all universities to explore a future career in research. 
</p>

</p>

</ul>

<b>Research Expectations: </b>

<ul>

<li> <b>Expectations to students:</b>
If you are interested in doing a PhD, please think about it carefully before committing yourself to a PhD. 
<a href= "http://www.aamircheema.com/PhD-guide.php">Should you really do PhD?</a>
In addition to being diligent, honest and willing to learn new knowledge on your own, you also need to demonstrate a solid background in computer science or related STEM fields and a genuine passion for solving critical emerging research problems.
Your research outcomes shall target top-tier conference/journal publications or real-world impact to industry partners. 
</li>

<li> <b>From supervisor support:</b>
I commit at least 1-2 hour weekly meetings for each student to discuss research progress, particularly in the beginning period of the research journey. 
I am also strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and networking opportunities. 
I have co-supervised over ten students to graduate, and primarily supervised students who are highly sought after by good employers, 
for both internship and full-time opportunities.
