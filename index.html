<A NAME="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></A>
<ul>

<li> 
I am an ARC DECRA Fellow | UniSA Enterprise Fellow, Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence (AI) within STEM (Infomation Technology). 

UniSA is a <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/about-unisa/university-achievements/">top young university</a> globally recognised as strong <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/impact-stories/">research impact and industry engagement</a>, located at <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/about-unisa/working-at-unisa/living-in-adelaide/">Adelaide</a>. 
	
I am leading the human-machine interaction and learning research, connecting with Research Centres for <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/industrial-ai/">Industrial AI</a> and <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/ive/"> Virtual and Interactive Environments</a>.
</li> 

</p> 

<li> 
I received the prestigious, highly competitive ARC <a href="https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra">Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)</a> Fellowship 2022 and currently hold an exceptional UniSA <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/about-unisa/working-at-unisa/vacancies/enterprise-fellows/"> Enterprise Fellowship</a> from 2021, which provide research-intensive career development. 

Before joining UniSA, I worked at the University of Technology Sydney and University of Tasmania, and completed my PhD from <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute">Australian AI Institute</a> in 2017.

<b>Research Expectations: </b>

<ul>

<li> <b>Expectations to students:</b>
If you are interested in doing a PhD, please think about it carefully before committing yourself to a PhD -
<a href= "http://www.aamircheema.com/PhD-guide.php">Should you really do PhD?</a>
In addition to being diligent, honest and willing to learn new knowledge "on your own", you also need to demonstrate a solid background in computer science or related STEM fields and a genuine passion for solving critical emerging research problems.
Your research outcomes shall target top-tier conference/journal publications or real-world impact to industry partners. 
</li>

<li> <b>From supervisor support:</b>
PhD training and career development will be provided for a research area in six incremental levels: awareness, understanding, replication, elaboration, innovation, and pioneer. I commit at least 1-2 hour weekly meetings for each student to discuss research progress, particularly in the beginning period of the research journey. I am also strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and networking opportunities. I have co-supervised over ten students to graduate, and my primarily supervised students are highly sought after by good employers, for both internship and full-time opportunities.
